# Security Policy
Our project is a command-line based calendar system designed to aid students in planning their study. We recognise the need for data protection and security, as well as the importance of maintaining secure software. This security policy outlines our method for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of our system.

## Data Security
Our calendar handles sensitive information regarding the whereabouts and times of a student's classes.

### Data Storage
The storage of user data is handled locally to ensure the safety of the sensitive data, and no data is shared or transmitted to third-party services.

### Data Encryption
We would recommend that where possible, users use encrypted file systems on their machines to store their calendar data so that their data is safe. Future versions of our software may include encrypted calendars.

### Data Access
Only authorised users should have access to the calendar files, so we recommend using OS-level authentication for access to local files.

## Authentication
Currently, the calendar program does not require authentication and is run locally, but in future releases we plan to include an authentication system as well as secure cloud storage mechanisms to further improve security.

## Software Updates
We continously monitor the Discord and GitHub for any issues or bugs that appear. In the event of a vulnerability, we will provide a patch as well as an explanation for the issue.

## Third-Party Dependencies
Our software does not use any third-party dependencies, which reduces the risk of supply-chain attacks.

# Conclusion
Security is a shared responsibility, and while we aim to provide a secure tool for students, we encourage users to follow the best practices for security, including using secure passwords and keeping software updated.
